> Use the content/ directory to create a file-based CMS for your application.

[Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/) reads the `content/` directory in your project and parses `.md`, `.yml`, `.csv` and `.json` files to create a file-based CMS for your application.
- Render your content with built-in components.
- Query your content with a MongoDB-like API.
- Use your Vue components in Markdown files with the MDC syntax.
- Automatically generate your navigation.
