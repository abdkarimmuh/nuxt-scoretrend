# assets
> The assets/ directory is used to add all the website's assets that the build tool will process.

The directory usually contains the following types of files:

- Stylesheets (CSS, SASS, etc.)
- Fonts
- Images that won't be served from the [`public/`](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/assets) directory.

If you want to serve assets from the server, we recommend taking a look at the [`public/`](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/assets) directory.
